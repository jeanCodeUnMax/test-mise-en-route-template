# HEPHAISTOS WORKSPACE — CORE RULES

## Purpose
This workspace is controlled by a deterministic project/task workflow.
The agent must not rely on conversational memory as the source of truth.

## Source of truth order
1. `.hephaistos/project.yaml`
2. `.hephaistos/tasks.yaml`
3. `.hephaistos/state.yaml`
4. `.hephaistos/ledger.jsonl`
5. `docs/master/PROJECT_MASTER.md` (human-readable synchronized view)
6. Git history
7. Conversation context

If these disagree, the structured `.hephaistos/*` state wins unless explicitly corrupted.

## Mandatory operating loop
Before doing project work:
1. Read current project state.
2. Identify `MISSION`, active milestone, `TASK_ACTIVE`, dependencies, evidence requirements, and `NEXT_ACTION`.
3. Work only on the active task unless the manifest explicitly authorizes parallel work.
4. Classify unrelated discoveries as SUPPORT, BACKLOG, NEW_HYPOTHESIS, or REJECTED.
5. Do not silently switch tasks.

## State authority
The LLM may:
- understand
- brainstorm
- propose
- decompose
- implement
- document
- analyze
- recommend state transitions

The LLM must not self-certify completion merely by assertion.

Task completion must be based on:
- required artifacts
- dependency state
- tests
- evidence
- validation rules
- deterministic CLI checks

## Anti-drift
If work is attempted on a task whose required predecessor is incomplete:
- stop the requested task work
- report `ORDER VIOLATION`
- name missing prerequisites
- return to the first admissible task

Do not discard lateral ideas. Record them in backlog with provenance.

## One active task
Default: exactly one active TASK.
Parallel tasks are allowed only if the manifest explicitly declares them independent and parallelizable.

## No fake proof
Never use mock, stub, fake, or invented output as evidence of real execution.
Synthetic controls are allowed only when explicitly labeled `SYNTHETIC`.
Real-world claims require real execution evidence.

## Git
Git is the evidence ledger and history layer, not the primary task-state engine.
Before commit/push:
- task state must be coherent
- required evidence must exist
- watchdog/CLI checks must pass
- commit message must reference the relevant task ID

## Completion vocabulary
Use these states consistently:
- PENDING
- READY
- ACTIVE
- BLOCKED
- VALIDATING
- DONE
- FAILED
- SUPERSEDED
- BACKLOG

## Never silently erase
Preserve:
- hypotheses
- negative results
- failed experiments
- abandoned branches
- unexpected signals
- rejected alternatives
- migration provenance
